Ukraine,2025-06-02,,Draft Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine “On Amendment to Clause 3 of the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 537 of 7 May 2022”,"The draft Resolution has been developed to prevent the introduction of particularly dangerous animal diseases into the territory of Ukraine and to improve the mechanisms of veterinary control over the transit of productive animals._x000D_
It proposes to amend Clause 3 of the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 537 of 7 May 2022 by setting it out in a revised version._x000D_
The draft Resolution provides for the establishment of the legal grounds for the movement of products originating from countries subject to restrictions due to outbreaks of diseases listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), or other diseases that pose a threat to human and/or animal health, as defined by the legislation of Ukraine or international law. It also contains provisions for regulating imports of consignments with productive animals and reproductive material from establishments not considered compliant with the legislation of Ukraine, as well as the transit of such consignments exclusively through territories officially recognized by the competent authority of the relevant country as free from particularly dangerous animal diseases._x000D_
The proposed amendments are essential, as they will ensure the effective implementation of mechanisms to prevent the import of high-risk animal products, implement veterinary and sanitary measures aimed at ensuring epizootic safety and protect the territory of Ukraine from the introduction or spread of particularly dangerous animal diseases from other countries. ","Food, feed, by-products of animal origin, live animals",,,Food safety (SPS); Animal health (SPS); Protect humans from animal/plant pest or disease (SPS),Human health; Animal health; Food safety; Animal diseases,,2025-08-01,Regular notification,"https://members.wto.org/crnattachments/2025/SPS/UKR/25_03617_00_e.pdf
